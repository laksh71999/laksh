 Hey There! This is my website where,<!-- laglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglag --><p> You can know about me.</p>
<p> Hi, My name is Lakshmanan.</p> <!-- ksjdokhdfgdufdfkjhfkjahdfkjhafkjhakf -->
<p> It was not so long ago that I understood I am an Electrical Engineer, so I am as complicated and techie for others. But, my complications are nothing seems to be worry for me. Because I like it. They are completely unique. I find some of my skills and activities are admirable and very attractive, while others find them terrible. I guess it is all a piece of the puzzle that is called personality. To know more about me feel free to vist my portfolio <a href="laksh_portfolio/index.html">Click Here..</a></p><!-- kjdhjhgdgldjhgdwtoiewotwotjdfkjdfffsf -->
<p> After completing my B. E. - Electrical and Electronics Engineering, I started to work as a Technical Engineer. Also, I am doing some freelance work like Web designing and projects in robotics. Since, I have interest to do and learn more about hardware and software, I am doing research in that field.</p><!-- hsdgfhjfkdjhfkjsdhfkjdshfkjsdhfkjsdhkfjhdskjfhksdjhfkdsj -->
<p> I have also published a paper called "Real-time detection and tracking of human based on image processing with laser pointing" in IEEE XPLORE after doing research in my final semester.
